# Hugo Portfolio Site Learning Project

This repository contains the source code for my Hugo portfolio site learning project. I created this project to learn how to use Hugo, a static site generator, to build a basic portfolio website.

This project serves as a learning experience for understanding how to use Hugo's command-line interface to create content pages and define layouts for a static website.

**Getting Started**

Run hugo server -D.

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:1313 to view the site.
